# Introduction

Music making in 16th Century England was practical, something that is reflected in many of the writings of music during this time. In particular, the way that music theorists, who were often teachers, engaged with the concept of The Gamut demonstrates their dedication to practice but also their willingness to focus on pragmatic ways of discussing the way that pitch space is formed in music of the time. Through both close and distant reading, this project discusses how the words used to describe the concept of "The Scale of Music" in two musical Treatises from England during the Renaissance were directed to students and dictated how to conceptualize the Gamut 

# Backgroud

## A Brief Introduction to Renaissance Music Theory
While the scope of this paper does not include a full analysis or explanation of music theory in the Renaissance, an important concept needed to understand its implications in distant reading comes from a close reading of the idea of the "Scale of Music" or "Gamut." The Gamut, a shortened version of "gamma ut," is the solmization of the lowest note on the medieval letter notation system (Morley, 1597). Like the musical staff used for notation today, musicians in the sixteenth century would place letters on a series of lines and spaces to help them determine what notes a musician should sing. They are labeled with the letters A-G. In order to interpret the Gamut, musicians must know the intervallic pitch content associated with the letters; this is the context that allows them to understand what these letters mean. This is similar to the way that letters apart have little meaning, but when placed in word. The letters for the Gamut can be seen on the left side of the diagram that appeared in Morley's A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke (1597):

The Renaissance conception of pitch space, or how notes relate to one another, contextualizes pitches together through their intervallic relationship through the hexachord. The hexachord has six syllables that a singer can use: ut, re, mi, fa, sol, and la, taken from the phrase "Ut queant laxis."  The distance between mi-fa always indicates a semitone (half-step) while the others (ut-re, fa-sol, sol-la) are whole tone (whole step). Therefore, if a singer is able to name one note with a letter and a syllable from the hexachord, they can determine the intervals surrounding that note. For example, E mi indicates that the letter above (F fa) will be a half-step. The letter below (D re) will be a whole step lower. The full name of a note can be found by reading from left to right on chart of the gamut.

*The Hexachord Solfege Syllables with their Intervallic Structure*

With this logic, the hexachords could start on one of three letters: C (natural hexachord), F (soft hexachord), and G (hard hexachord). The softe hexachord is an interesting case because it contains the flat B to accomadate a half step from A to B-Flat. Because not all pieces remained in the small space of six notes, the meant singers needed to mutate between the natural hexachord and either the soft or hard depending on wether or not the piece had a flat in it. Along with the gamut and hexachords, a clefe was also used to help identify where notes would be sung. These clefs are derived from the same notes that the hexachords are built from F, C, and G named according to their placement on the gamut.


## Text Selection

The Gamut and the understanding of it was one of the primary ways that musicians conceived pitch space, or the way that pitches are perceived in relation to one another. While there is clearly an influence of continental ideas in many texts involving music theory in England during the 16th century, one significant change English theorists made from their Continental counterpoints was changes in solmization that lead to a change in English musicians understandings of how the gamut worked.  

The texts chosen for this project were taken from the [Texts on Music in English from the Medieval and Early Modern Eras (TME)](https://chmtl.indiana.edu/tme/). The website is maintained by the Center for the History of Music Theory and Literature (CHMTL) at the Indiana University Jacobs School of music. The project itself initiated and started by Peter M. Leffert (School of Music, University of Nebraska-Lincoln) with th goal of collecting and transcribing major texts about music from the fourteenth through seventeenth century in electronic form. For this project the texts chose were from the sixteenth and seventeenth century as this was a time of great change and development in the field of music theory and pedagogy in England at the time. 

The first texts chosen were William Bathe’s A Briefe Introduction to the Skill of Song and A Brief Introduction to the True Art of Music. Though no date is written on the manuscript, the work is thought to be written around 1596 due to its inclusion in Maunsell's 1595 catalogue (Huray, 2001). In her book Music Theory in Seventieth Century England, Rebecca Herissone comments that there was an “increasing awareness that modern pitch structure was based on the seven-note scale.” The English were increasingly concerned with the practicality of teaching people to sing as indicated by the use of words such as “Practical” or “brief” in the titles of their treatises. This treatise was important to musical thought in England due to Bathe’s application of the “Rule of Ut.” While the rule follows the traditional view that “Ut,” the lowest note of the hexachord may be placed on either C, F, or G, he concludes that this naming, be applied to any equivalent letter on the gamut. This allows Bathe to generate three “scales” that encompass three different keys: one with no flats, one flat, and two flats.

<img width="386" alt="Screen Shot 2021-06-05 at 2 18 50 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72164586/120904336-f48f4480-c608-11eb-8489-fe5b35bc6c67.png">

[*Bathe Three Scales from A Briefe Introduction to the Skill of Song*](https://chmtl.indiana.edu/tme/16th/BATHBISS_02GF.gif)

Bathe’s signatures do not imply keys in the same way that we understand them today. A signature with no flats today implies C Major or A Minor, but the signature in Bathe’s work determines the solfege but not a modal final. This development notes the chaning views of pitch space in 16th Century England and relects an move away from the conception of "mode" that is discussed in other texts of the period. 

The second text for this project was writte by Thomas Morley, who was heavily involved in music making in England. He acted not only as a teacher, but a composer, translator, arranger, and editor His Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke from 1597 is largely considered to be one of the most, if not the most, important treatise on music written in English from the period. The text is interesting not only for its discussion of practical musical topics, abscense of explanations of mode, or mix of English and Italian ideas, but also its use of dialogue form, perhaps referencing the Italian theorist Gioseffo Zarlino’s *Le istitutioni harmoniche* (1558). 


# Methodology

Most research done within the analysis of music theory texts involves close reading of the text to identify main ideas and descriptions of important musical topics such as mode or meter. This paper will supplement close reading with the use of distant reading and topic modeling to gain new insight into how these two authors discuss music and what concepts are common across their work. While there has been some work done in the fields of music theory and musicology, there are barriers in place that can prevent the use of tools for larger computational practice to be difficult to implement. 

One major setback is the lack of textual material associated with music theory in electronic forms. While the work done on projects such as Texts on Music in English from the Medieval and Early Modern Eras or Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum are providing sources for this work, they are not optimized for different types of textual analysis and require cleaning and preparation before they can be used effectively. 

## Tools and Techniques

Two tools were used to supplement close reading of the texts: Voyant and MALLET.

### Voyant

In order to perform distant reading, the tool Voyant was used. [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#/guide/about) is a web-based tool for evaluating digital texts created by Stéfan Sinclair and Geoffrey Rockwell. It allows users to uplaod digital text files for processing in a variety of ways including determining collates, visualizing trends, and compare documents across the given corpus. 
 
For this project, Voyant was used to determine recurring words, their context, and relationships to others concerning different aspects of pitch space such as solfege or clefs. The goal was to understand the use of words from a larger level to supplement interpretations of conecpts derived through close reading. 
 
### MALLET
[MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/) is a open source tool for natural language processing and topic modeling created by Andrew McCallum . Its use in this project was to determine what areas (topics) both Morley and Bathe discuss in their treatises. The topics were trained over the entier corpus and then applied to both Morley and Bathe individually.

## Preparing Texts

To prepare the texts for this project, the links, and annotations listed on the TME needed to be removed and the files needed to be split into documents that were readable by both Voyant and MALLET. This process was determined primarily based on the sections laid out by TME. 

Morley’s book is divided into three major parts:  Teaching to Sing, Treating to Descant, 
Treating of Composing or Setting of Songs which models three important aspects of becoming a well rounded musician in the renaissance. Due to this clear division of the book, the book itself was split into four documents, reflecting these three of instruction sections and the end matter as its own document. Bathe’s portion of the Coprus is divided into two parts: A Briefe Introduction to the Skill of Song (1589, reprint ca. 1596) and A Brief Introduction to the True Art of Music. This leads to the creation of six primary documents for use in Voyant:

|Document Title|Author|Title|
|-|-|-|
|morley_01|Thomas Morley|Teaching to Sing|
|morley_02|Thomas Morley|Treating to Descant|
|morley_03|Thomas Morley|Treating of Composing or Setting of Songs|
|morley_04|Thomas Morley|End Matter|
|bathe_01|William Bathe|A Briefe Introduction to the Skill of Song|
|bathe_02|William Bathe|A Brief Introduction to the True Art of Music|

*Documents Used for Voyant* 

Along with the preperation of texts was the preperation of a [stop word list](https://github.com/mmnewman/DH_Final/files/6603455/morley_bathe_stoplist.txt) that was tailored for Middle English. This was done through looking through the texts for common English words with varient spellings (i.e. any for anies). Due to the specific nature of the texts, there was also consideration for common words that may have distinct meanings in music such as "re," wich acts as a solfege syllable and not as commonly to refer to something concerning something else. Once the corpus was uploaded to Voyant, the stoplist was adjusted once more to remove any words missed by hand. This also lead to the addition of the names in Morley's text to the coprus as they were not as important to the corpus as a whole as the individial book.

The documents for Mallet were reduced to contain 1-2 sentences per document to allow for more percieces topics in training the model. This meant adjusting the texts that were cleaned for Voyant and splitting them into individual text files. Thes text files were stored in a folder and imported as a directory to MALLET. 

# Results and Discussion

## The Corpus 
Between all six documents, [the coprus](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=f8d87652557f789fe522e47988f701e1) contains 85,664 total words with 6,314 of those words being unique word forms. Morley's documents are significantly longer than Bathe which may indicate that through the process of distant reading, Morley's texts will be more heavily weighted. Of the three main sections of Morley's book, the section on Composing and Setting Songs was the longest with about 10,000 more words than the next longest document, indicating his references to other theachers such as Tallis and Zarlino. 

|Rank|Document Title|Word Count|
|-|-|-|
|1|morley_03|24816|
|2|morley_01|14024|
|3|morley_02|17580|
|4|morley_04|16177|
|6|bathe_01|6978|
|6|bathe_02|6089|

*Voyant Document Rank, Title, and Word Count listed from Largest to Smallest*

The most used word in the corpus is the word Note* (adjusted to include both the singular and plural form of the word). This note is used extensively by both Bathe and Morley and is generally used with the same conceptual understanding as a word to describe what a musical sound. This sound can either be used in relation to pitch (frequency in the present day understanding) or rhythm (duration). In general, note is associated with the placing of the musical sounds on the gamut. This may be in reference to where a note "stands" on the gamut or the solfege used to sing a note as indicated by the links between "note/s," "standeth," and "fa."

<img width="400" alt="Collocates with the word Note" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72164586/120906714-0547b680-c619-11eb-929b-1e8c836ade70.png">

*Collocates with the word "Note"*

This finding supports the importance of the Gamut in teaching and instructring musicans to sing that is derived from a close reading of the text. The note is the primary building block of pitch space in English Theory, representing both the act of creating music and the pitch that is meant to be sung in relation to the gamut. Notes are represented through they names given on the gamut and are used to describe both the concepts of clef and key, meaning that it is the first thing students must learn to sing. The term note is used consistantly throughout the documents almost emphasizing the practicality of the writing. 

<img width="530" alt="Screen Shot 2021-06-05 at 4 20 51 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72164586/120906836-0200fa80-c61a-11eb-89f9-7fc8892f8bbe.png">

*Use of the word Note over all documents except morley_04 (End Matter)*

Both Morley and Bathe call the naming of notes the “Scale of Musicke.” Interestingly, they have almost the same thing to say in terms learning to sing the Gamut: 

> *...and learne it perfectly without booke, to say it forwards and backewards: to know, wherein euery key standeth, whether in rule or in space: and how many Cliefes, how many Notes is contayned in euery Key.* -Bathe

> *Then must you get it perfectly without booke, to saie it forwards and backwards. Secondly, You must learne to knowe, wherein euery Keye standeth, that is, whether in rule or in space. And thirdly, How manie cliefes and how manie notes euery Key containeth.* -Morley

This could indicate many things, but does show a tendency to view the Gamut as the starting point for understanding and engaging with music. The Scale of music describes both the note names as well as their context in a given clef or system. Solfege acts as a sort of link for understanding how the concepts of the naming of notes moves into practice. Other more complicated topics such as clef are reached through their linking to the notes themselves through solfege.

## Coprus Topics

The topics for the coprus were generated using Mallet and running through 3000 iterations with 15 topics and the Optimize Interval set to 30. While some topics generated were less useful, there were 6 of particular interest in the case of identifying patters in the coprus: 

|Rank|Document Title|Topic Name|Topic Words
|-|-|-|-|
|1|0.23261|Teaching|philomathes master notes marg sing haue pray goe giue note time begin speake praie musicke singing tune till manie saie|
|2|0.18054|Practice|haue set make part wil downe vpon hath true vse beene musicke notes good reason thinke rest likewise made sing |
|4|0.15847|The Gamut|note place sol standeth notes flat euery rule gam sharp named aboue bee order places names verse vnder called song |
|5|0.14802|Meter|time perfect prolation lesse proportion moode signe pricke stroke set vnperfect euery semibriefe tripla dupla semibriefes notes master downe numbers |
|6| 0.03|Intervals|fift kind fourth tunes tune diapason aboue diuide key elami halfe diapente ancient lowest vnder euery diuided kinds highest kindes |

The Teaching Topic is the most waited topic, reflecting the larger text in the corpus generated by Morley. It reflects both the names of Philomathes (student) and the Master in relation to singing, notes and instructions such as "begin." This topic is easily paired with teh second most weighted being the Practice topic that indicates general instructions of "setting down a note" or explaining how a musician might think through an idea. Despite the influence of Morley in the Coprus, there is a trend for both of these authors to use similar words to descibe what a student should engage with music and what aspects of it are important to learn. 

In particular the topic deemed "The Gamut" is associated with differet words that indicate pitch space in Renaissance Theory. This topic deals with where notes are placed on the spaces and lines and the order in which they exist. Both Morley and Bathe talk of this topic extensively and both start their main discussions by explaining where the notes sit in relation to lines and spaces. This once again indicates the practicality of the texts and demonstrates how these topics build to support other more complicated ones such as the intervals topic that deals more with the writing of songs and combination of notes than the notes themselves.

# Conclusions

This analysis has shown that The Gamut plays an important role in the way that these two theory texts understand and teach music. It is the place from which they start and the foundation for more complicated music making ideas. The use of tools like Voyant and Mallet can help to contextualize and solidify aspects of these texts that support the idea that pitch space was tied to the Gamut in 16th Century English Theory and that the texts themselves were aimed heavily at the practice of music making in realtion to these theoretical ideas. To furthur thus research, the corpus could be expanded to include more variety of musical texts about music from otehr English composers. Additionally, a comparison between topics in English Texts and Latin/Italian texts might indicate differences between ways of teaching and conceptualizing pitch space in different cultures or bring to light similarities between ideas between composer from different continents.
