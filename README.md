# Introduction

The music and theory of 16th century England lies in an “in-between” that provides a fruitful ground for the questions of tonality, modality, and its effective qualities.

## A Brief Introduction to Renaissance Music Theory
While the scope of this paper does not include a full analysis or explanation of music theory in the Renaissance, there are two important concepts needed to understand its implications: Gamut and Mode. The Gamut, a shortened version of "gamma ut," is the solmization of the lowest note on the medieval letter notation system (Morley, DATE). Like the musical staff used for notation today, musicians in the sixteenth century would place letters on a series of lines and spaces to help them determine what notes a musician should sing. They are labeled with the letters A-G. In order to interpret the Gamut, musicians must know the intervallic pitch content <img width="417" alt="Screen Shot 2021-06-05 at 11 16 32 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72164586/120899953-7d998200-c5ef-11eb-9dda-32accb481d07.png">
associated with the letters; this is the context that allows them to understand what these letters mean. This is similar to the way that letters apart have little meaning, but when placed in word.

The Continental conception of pitch space relates the pitches together through their intervallic relationship through the hexachord. The hexachord has six syllables that a singer can use: ut, re, mi, fa, sol, and la. The distance between mi-fa always indicates a half step while the others (ut-re, fa-sol, sol-la) are whole steps. The hexachords could start on one of three letters: C (natural hexachord), F (soft hexachord), and G (hard hexachord). Because not all pieces remained in the small space of six notes, the meant singers needed to mutate the hexachord to sing a full song. 

The Gamut and the understanding of it was one of the primary ways that musicians conceived pitch space, or the way that pitches are perceived in relation to one another. While there is clearly an influence of continental ideas in many texts involving music theory in England during the 16th century, one significant change English theorists made from their Continental counterpoints was changes in solmization that lead to a change in English musicians understandings of how the gamut worked.  In her book Music Theory in Seventieth Century England, Rebecca Herissone comments that there was an “increasing awareness that modern pitch structure was based on the seven-note scale.” The English were increasingly concerned with the practicality of teaching people to sing as indicated by the use of words such as “Practical” or “brief” in the titles of their treatises. 


## Text Selection

The texts chosen for this project were taken from the [Texts on Music in English from the Medieval and Early Modern Eras (TME)](https://chmtl.indiana.edu/tme/). The website is maintained by the Center for the History of Music Theory and Literature (CHMTL) at the Indiana University Jacobs School of music. The project itself initiated and started by Peter M. Leffert (School of Music, University of Nebraska-Lincoln) with th goal of collecting and transcribing major texts about music from the fourteenth through seventeenth century in electronic form. For this project the texts chose were from the sixteenth and seventeenth century as this was a time of great change and development in the field of music theory and pedagogy in England at the time (_____). Three texts were chosen for both their importance in the field of music theory and their authors importance in music history.

The first text chosen was William Bathe’s A Briefe Introduction to the Skill of Song. Though no date is written on the manuscript, the work is thought to be written around 1596 due to its inclusion in Maunsell's 1595 catalogue (Huray, 2001). This treatise was important to musical thought in England due to Bathe’s application of the “Rule of Ut.” While the rule follows the traditional view that “Ut,” the lowest note of the hexachord may be placed on either C,F, or G, he concludes that this naming, be applied to any equivalent letter on the gamut. This allows Bathe to generate three “scales” that encompass three different keys: one with no flats, one flat, and two flats. 

[Example of the Three Scales]

Bathe’s signatures do not imply keys in the same way that we understand them today. A signature with no flats today implies C Major or A Minor, but the signature in Bathe’s work determines the solfege but not a modal final. Due to this important development, this work was chosen for the project. 

Thomas Morley was heavily involved in music making in England. He acted not only as a teacher, but a composer, translator, arranger, and editor His Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke from 1597 is largely considered to be one of the most, if not the most, important treatise on music written in English from the period. The text is interesting not only for its discussion of practical musical topics, abscense of explanations of mode, or mix of English and Italian ideas, but also its use of dialogue form, perhaps referencing the Italian theorist Gioseffo Zarlino’s Le istitutioni harmoniche (1558). 


# Methodology

As most research done within the analysis of music theory texts involves close reading of the text to identify main ideas and descriptions of important musical topics such as mode or meter. This paper will supplement close reading with the use of distant reading and topic modeling to gain new insight into how these two authors discuss music and what concepts are common across their work. While there has been some work done in the fields of music theory an

## Tools and Techniques
## Preparing Texts

To prepare the texts for this project, the links, and annotations listed on the TME needed to be removed and the files needed to be split into documents that were readable by both Voyant and MALLET. This process was determined primarily based on the sections laid out by TME. 

Morley’s book is divided into three major parts:  Teaching to Sing, Treating to Descant, 
Treating of Composing or Setting of Songs which models three important aspects of becoming a well rounded musician in the renaissance. Due to this clear division of the book, the book itself was split into four documents, reflecting these three of instruction sections and the end matter as its own document. Bathe’s portion of the Coprus is divided into two parts: A Briefe Introduction to the Skill of Song (1589, reprint ca. 1596) and A Brief Introduction to the True Art of Music. This leads to the creation of six primary documents for use in Voyant.
